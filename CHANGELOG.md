# Rexel Changelog

## [1.4.1] - 2025-02-21
### Added
- **Fixed `nil` behavior**: Added explicit return values and improved error handling to avoid returning `nil` without feedback.
- **Disabled automatic interactive mode**: Rexel will now only enter interactive mode if no arguments are passed (i.e., no script file). Running `rexel test.rx` will now process the script instead of entering interactive mode.
  
### Fixed
- **Error handling improvements**: Enhanced error handling to ensure all commands, functions, and expressions return meaningful values or error messages.
- **Exit code handling**: Proper exit codes are now returned for commands like `exit` to ensure a cleaner, more informative termination.

### Changed
- **Script execution improvements**: If a script is provided as an argument (`rexel test.rx`), Rexel will execute it without entering interactive mode. Error messages are now clearer for script failures.

## **v1.4.0**
### New Features:
- **`run` Command**: Added the ability to execute external commands with the `run` keyword (e.g., `run /bin/ls` or `run /path/to/script.sh`).
- **Error Handling Enhancements**: Improved error messages to include line numbers and positions in the source code for better debugging.
- **Improved Concurrency**: Enhanced threading support for concurrent task execution with the addition of the `thread` command.
- **Custom Data Structures**: Introduced HashMap and Set support for better data handling and manipulation.
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added the `debug` command for better runtime inspection and tracing.
- **File I/O Enhancements**: Introduced functions for reading and writing files, as well as appending to files.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed issues related to the parsing of complex expressions.
- Addressed an issue where certain operators were not properly parsed.

### Other Changes:
- Updated the interpreter to handle a broader range of valid expressions.
- Improved the REPL interface for better user experience.
- Refined memory management for better performance.
